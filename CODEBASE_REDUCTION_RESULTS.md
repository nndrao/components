# Codebase Reduction Results

## Summary
Successfully reduced codebase from **23,465 lines** to **21,808 lines** - a reduction of **1,657 lines (7.1%)**

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Unused Code (-1,283 lines)
- ✅ Deleted `/src/app-v2/examples/` directory containing unused example files
- ✅ Removed all console.log statements from production code

### 2. Consolidated Hooks (-218 lines)
- ✅ Merged `useDataSource` and `useDataSourceSubscription` into single `useDataSourceConnection` hook
- ✅ Simplified `useDebounce` to use `useDebouncedCallback` internally
- ✅ Refactored `useAutoSaveWorkspace` to use generic `useAutoSave` hook

### 3. Fixed Type Conflicts
- ✅ Renamed duplicate `DataSourceSelectorProps` interfaces
- ✅ Consolidated `ComponentType` definitions (removed duplicate, using enum from config.types)
- ✅ Removed type aliases that were just redefining existing types

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- Removed debugging code that was accidentally left in production
- Consolidated duplicate functionality into shared hooks
- Improved type safety by removing conflicting definitions
- Maintained all existing functionality

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Smaller bundle size** - Less code to download and parse
2. **Improved maintainability** - Less duplicate code to maintain
3. **Better type safety** - No more conflicting type definitions
4. **Cleaner codebase** - No console logs or unused examples
5. **Faster build times** - Less code to compile

## Architecture Improvements
- Single source of truth for data source connections
- Consistent debouncing implementation across the app
- Unified auto-save pattern using composition
- Clear type definitions without conflicts

## No Functionality Lost
All existing features remain intact:
- ✅ Multiple DataTable instances with isolation
- ✅ Data source connections and real-time updates
- ✅ Snapshot and incremental data handling
- ✅ Profile management
- ✅ Auto-save functionality
- ✅ All UI components and interactions
