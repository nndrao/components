# Multiple Active DataSources Implementation

## Overview
Fixed the architecture to support multiple DataTables, each with its own independent data source subscription. Previously, there was only one global `activeDataSourceId` which caused conflicts when multiple DataTables tried to use different data sources.

## Key Changes

### 1. Created `useDataSourceSubscription` Hook
- **Location**: `/hooks/useDataSourceSubscription.ts`
- **Purpose**: Allows each component to independently subscribe to a data source
- **Features**:
  - Local data source state per component
  - Independent data batching (60ms intervals)
  - Automatic connection management
  - Memory-efficient with 10,000 record limit

### 2. Updated DataSourceContext
- **Removed**: Global `activeDataSourceId` and `data` state
- **Removed**: Global data batching logic
- **Kept**: Data source configuration management and connection status
- **Modified**: `sendTrigger` now requires dataSourceId parameter

### 3. Updated DataTable Component
- **Uses**: `useDataSourceSubscription` hook for local data source management
- **Each DataTable**:
  - Has its own data source selection
  - Maintains its own data stream
  - Saves its selection in component config
  - Can switch data sources independently

### 4. Updated DataSourceSelector
- **Changed**: From global state to local props
- **Props**: `value` and `onChange` for controlled component pattern
- **Maintains**: Auto-connect functionality and status display

## Architecture Benefits

1. **True Independence**: Each DataTable can connect to different data sources
2. **No Conflicts**: Changing one DataTable's source doesn't affect others
3. **Performance**: Each component has its own data batching
4. **Scalability**: Can have unlimited DataTables with different sources

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Each DataTable manages its own data source
<DataTable id="table1" /> // Can use WebSocket source A
<DataTable id="table2" /> // Can use WebSocket source B
<DataTable id="table3" /> // Can use sample data

// Each maintains its own:
// - Data source selection
// - Real-time data stream
// - Connection management
// - Batching and performance optimization
```

## Data Flow

```
DataSourceContext (Global)
├── Manages all data source configurations
├── Tracks connection status for all sources
└── Provides connection/disconnection methods

DataTable Component (Instance)
├── Uses useDataSourceSubscription hook
├── Has local dataSourceId state
├── Receives data specific to its source
└── Saves selection in component config

useDataSourceSubscription (Per Component)
├── Subscribes to specific data source
├── Manages local data batching
├── Handles connection lifecycle
└── Provides data stream to component
```

## Fixed Issues

1. **Infinite Loop**: Fixed by properly managing useEffect dependencies
2. **State Conflicts**: Each DataTable now has independent state
3. **Data Mixing**: Data streams are properly isolated per component
4. **Performance**: Each component optimizes its own data flow

This implementation allows for a truly scalable multi-data-source architecture where each DataTable component can independently connect to and display data from different sources without any conflicts or performance issues.
