# DataTable Snapshot Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a snapshot-first data loading pattern for DataTables. When a DataTable selects a data source, it now:

1. **Waits for the initial snapshot** before displaying any data
2. **Shows a loading state** while waiting for the snapshot
3. **Only processes real-time updates** after the snapshot is received

## Technical Implementation

### 1. WebSocketDataProvider Changes
- Added `snapshotBuffer` to collect data until snapshot is complete
- Detects "Success: Starting live updates" message to mark snapshot completion
- Emits a `snapshot` event with all buffered data
- Only processes real-time updates after snapshot is complete

### 2. useDataSourceSubscription Hook
- Added state tracking: `loading`, `snapshotReceived`, `error`
- Listens for both `snapshot` and `data` events
- Ignores real-time `data` events until snapshot is received
- Provides loading state to components

### 3. DataTable Component
- Shows loading overlay while waiting for snapshot
- Displays status badge in toolbar (Loading â†’ Live)
- Only renders data after snapshot is received

## Data Flow

```
1. User selects data source
   â†“
2. DataTable shows "Waiting for snapshot..." overlay
   â†“
3. WebSocket connects and sends trigger
   â†“
4. Server sends snapshot data in batches
   â†“
5. WebSocketDataProvider buffers all snapshot data
   â†“
6. Server sends "Success: Starting live updates"
   â†“
7. WebSocketDataProvider emits 'snapshot' event with all data
   â†“
8. DataTable receives snapshot and displays data
   â†“
9. Real-time updates are now processed normally
```

## Visual Indicators

1. **Loading Overlay**: Semi-transparent overlay with spinner and "Waiting for snapshot data..." message
2. **Status Badge**: Shows current state in toolbar
   - ðŸ”„ "Waiting for snapshot..." (with spinner)
   - âœ… "Live" (after snapshot received)

## Benefits

1. **Data Consistency**: Users always see the complete initial state before updates
2. **Clear Loading State**: Users know when data is being loaded
3. **Performance**: Snapshot is delivered as one batch, reducing initial render cycles
4. **Reliability**: Real-time updates won't be processed out of order

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Select a data source in a DataTable
2. Observe the loading overlay appears
3. Wait for snapshot to complete (overlay disappears)
4. Verify the status badge shows "Live"
5. Confirm real-time updates are working

The snapshot pattern ensures data integrity and provides a better user experience when connecting to high-frequency data sources.
