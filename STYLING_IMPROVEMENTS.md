# Fields & Columns Styling Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Overlapping Text**
- **Problem**: Header names were overlapping with field names in the column list
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `min-w-0` to allow proper text truncation
  - Added `truncate` class to prevent text overflow
  - Consistent font sizes: `text-sm` for primary text, `text-xs` for secondary

### 2. **Inconsistent Heights**
- **Problem**: Fields and columns had different row heights
- **Solution**: Changed both to use `min-h-[2.5rem]` with `py-1` padding
- **Result**: Both lists now have the same comfortable row height

### 3. **Type Icons**
- **Problem**: Icons could shrink or misalign
- **Solution**: Added `flex-shrink-0` to all type icons
- **Enhancement**: Added support for both raw types ('number', 'date') and column types ('numericColumn', 'dateColumn')

### 4. **Layout Consistency**
- Made both lists use identical structure:
  ```
  [Checkbox] [TypeIcon] [Text Content] [Action Button]
  ```
- Both now show primary name and secondary path/field info

### 5. **Spacing Improvements**
- Reduced item spacing from `space-y-1` to `space-y-0.5` for tighter layout
- Adjusted padding from `p-4` to `p-3` for better visual balance
- Consistent `gap-3` between elements in both lists

## Visual Hierarchy

### Fields List:
```
‚ñ° üìù fieldName
     field.path (if different)
```

### Columns List:
```
‚ñ° üìù Header Name
     field.name
```

## Typography
- **Primary text**: `text-sm font-medium` - Clear and readable
- **Secondary text**: `text-xs text-muted-foreground` - Subtle supporting info
- **Truncation**: Long text now truncates with ellipsis instead of overlapping

## Professional Appearance
- Clean, consistent spacing
- Clear visual hierarchy
- No text overlap
- Proper text truncation
- Consistent interactive states (hover effects)
- Unified design language across both lists
