## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint

## Architecture

The project uses a clean, simplified architecture (v2) that prioritizes maintainability:

- **Single Store**: Zustand store manages all application state
- **Component-based**: Self-contained components with clear responsibilities
- **Direct State Access**: No complex service layers or abstractions
- **~500 lines total**: Compared to 3000+ in previous versions

See [documentation/APP_V2_ARCHITECTURE.md](documentation/APP_V2_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture information.
